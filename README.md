Welcome to the Maroon repository. Maroon is an interactive laboratory and experiment environment implemented in Unity, designed for active learning in the classroom or at home. It visualizes and simulates various experiments.

If you are looking for more information, downloads or web-builds feel free to visit our [website](https://maroon.tugraz.at/). If you are looking for details about software components, how to contribute to Maroon or other development-related information, you can consult our [wiki](https://github.com/GamesResearchTUG/Maroon/wiki).

# Overview
Maroon is an interactive and immersive laboratory developed in Unity, a
game engine which allows to build and deploy a high-quality 3D environment across
mobile, desktop and VR platforms. The lab is designed to support the flexible integration
of different interactive learning experiences.
To start a specific learning experience, the user can approach one
of those stations (illustrated with circular markers). From there the user can teleport to a new
room which represents the specific learning experiences with the learning content,
simulations, or experiments.

The following conceptual overview of the different versions of Maroon (Maroon Desktop, Maroon Room-Scale VR, Maroon Mobile VR and Maroon
Multi-User) illustrates the different forms of engagement Maroon supports or plans to support.

# Simulations and Experiments

Maroon contains several physics, chemistry, and computer science experiments, but will be extended with experiences from other STEM fields in the future. The physics experiments cover Coulomb's Law, Falling Coil, Faraday's Law, Huygen's Principle, Point Wave, Pendulum, Van de Graaff Balloon, Van de Graaff Generator, Optics, 3D Motion Simulation, Cathode Ray Tube, and Falling Ball Viscosimeter. The chemistry experiments are represented by Titration and Catalyst. And Computer Science experiments include Sorting, State Machine, Path Finding, Minimum Spanning Tree, and Perlin Noise.
